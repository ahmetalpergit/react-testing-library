# React Testing Library

> Learning how to do testing for React applications [Ahmet Alper](https://github.com/ahmetalpergit)

## Introduction

I've recently been working on an enterprise solution for a bank with a large team of developers. One of my tasks as a part of the Frontend development team was to write unit tests using Jest and Enzyme (which was soon replaced with React Testing Library). I've decided after writing tests on my own to take this course in order to be much more efficient with it and improve both the quality of my work for that job and for my own projects moving forward.

You can follow my progress on this repository. Enjoy!
